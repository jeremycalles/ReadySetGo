  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 21, 2025</p>

  <p>This privacy policy applies to <strong>TileScore</strong> (“the app”), a scorekeeping app for board games, card games, and similar activities.</p>

  <h2>Data collection</h2>
  <p>TileScore does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage data to our servers or any third party. The app does not use analytics, advertising, or crash-reporting services.</p>

  <h2>Data stored on your device</h2>
  <p>While you use the app, information such as player names and scores exists only in the app’s memory on your device. This data is not sent off the device and is not retained after you close the app, unless your device’s normal app lifecycle keeps the app in memory (e.g. in the background). We do not have access to this data.</p>

  <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>The app does not collect any personal information. It is suitable for users of all ages.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>Any changes to this privacy policy will be posted on this page and, when relevant, will be released with a new version of the app. The “Last updated” date at the top reflects the latest revision.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or the app, please contact us through the support channel provided in the App Store listing for TileScore.</p>

## Description
**Limit: 4,000 characters** • First ~255 characters appear in search results—make them count.

```
[App Name] is a lightweight score tracker for board games, card games, and any activity where you need to keep score for multiple players. No sign-in, no ads—just tap and play.

HOW IT WORKS

1. Choose how many players (1–8). Use + and − to set the count, then tap Next.

2. Enter each player’s name. Every player gets a unique color. Tap Start Game when you’re ready.

3. Track scores on the board. Each player has a tile showing their name and score. Tap a tile to add 1 point; long-press to subtract 1 (with confirmation). Reset scores or start a new game anytime from the bottom actions.

FEATURES

• Clean, modern interface with smooth animations and haptic feedback
• Color-coded tiles so everyone can see who’s ahead at a glance
• Layout adapts to your group: single column for 1–2 players, grid for 3–8
• Full VoiceOver support so the app is accessible to everyone
• No account required and no data collection—everything stays on your device

Built for game night, family nights, and anywhere you need a quick, fair way to keep score.
